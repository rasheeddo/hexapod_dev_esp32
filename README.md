The frame is from 3D printed parts, and the actuators are just RC servo as Futaba A700 and DS3225.

## Concept

Coordinate frame O is the placed on the center body where $`Y_O`$ is the pointing forward direction, and $`X_O`$ is pointing rigth-sided direction of robot would be going.


### Forward Kinametics

### Inverse Kinematics

### Foot motion for walking
